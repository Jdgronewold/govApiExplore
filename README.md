# Exploring Government Apis

This is a bare bones web application for users to explore the APIs provided by various governmental resources. Currently only Solar data (https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/solar-resource-v1/) and Weather/Natural Events (https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/eonet-project) are available.


## Features/Technology

- Angular Frontend
- MapBox API to turn location into Lat/Long coordinates
- D3.js to bind data to images and create scales necessary for plotting the scatter plot

## TODO

- Add Descriptions of each API service in the form section
